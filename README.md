googleCrawler
=============

Google Crawler is an experimental project for automatized scraping of google results for a given word or phrase. It stores the raw HTML of every page of the results returned by google, while it gives the user the opportunity to filter this raw HTML through regular expressions and get the actual results he/she had been searching for. Although the concept is a little bit abstract at the moment, the application can successfully be used in order to retrieve (for example) random or specific kinds of email addresses from the internet (for email marketing purposes)
